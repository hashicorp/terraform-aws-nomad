# Nomad AWS Module

This repo contains a set of modules in the [modules folder](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules) for deploying a [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) cluster on
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Nomad is a distributed, highly-available
data-center aware scheduler. A Nomad cluster typically includes a small number of server nodes, which are responsible
for being part of the [consensus protocol](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/internals/consensus.html), and a larger
number of client nodes, which are used for running jobs:

This repo includes:

* [install-nomad](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/install-nomad): This module can be used to install Nomad. It can be used in a
  [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) template to create a Nomad
  [Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html).

* [run-nomad](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/run-nomad): This module can be used to configure and run Nomad. It can be used in a
  [User Data](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html#user-data-shell-scripts)
  script to fire up Nomad while the server is booting.

* [nomad-cluster](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/nomad-cluster): Terraform code to deploy a cluster of Nomad servers using an [Auto Scaling
  Group](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/).




## How do you use this Module?

This repo has the following folder structure:

* [modules](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules): This folder contains several standalone, reusable, production-grade modules that you can use to deploy Nomad.
* [examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/examples): This folder shows examples of different ways to combine the modules in the `modules` folder to deploy Vault.
* [test](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/test): Automated tests for the modules and examples.
* [root](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master): The root folder is *an example* of how to use the [nomad-cluster module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/nomad-cluster) module to deploy a [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) cluster in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). The Terraform Registry requires the root of every repo to contain Terraform code, so we've put one of the examples there. This example is great for learning and experimenting, but for production use, please use the underlying modules in the [modules folder](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules) directly.

To run a production Nomad cluster, you need to deploy a small number of server nodes (typically 3), which are responsible
for being part of the [consensus protocol](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/internals/consensus.html), and a larger
number of client nodes, which are used for running jobs. You must also have a [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) cluster
deployed (see the [Consul AWS Module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul)) in one of the following
configurations:

1. [Deploy Nomad and Consul in the same cluster](#deploy-nomad-and-consul-in-the-same-cluster)
1. [Deploy Nomad and Consul in separate clusters](#deploy-nomad-and-consul-in-separate-clusters)


### Deploy Nomad and Consul in the same cluster

1. Use the [install-consul
   module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul/tree/master/modules/install-consul) from the Consul AWS
   Module and the [install-nomad module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/install-nomad) from this Module in a Packer template to create
   an AMI with Consul and Nomad.

   If you are just experimenting with this Module, you may find it more convenient to use one of our official public AMIs:
   - [Latest Ubuntu 16 AMIs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/_docs/ubuntu16-ami-list.md).
   - [Latest Amazon Linux AMIs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/_docs/amazon-linux-ami-list.md).

   **WARNING! Do NOT use these AMIs in your production setup. In production, you should build your own AMIs in your own
   AWS account.**

1. Deploy a small number of server nodes (typically, 3) using the [consul-cluster
   module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul/tree/master/modules/consul-cluster). Execute the
   [run-consul script](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul/tree/master/modules/run-consul) and the
   [run-nomad script](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/run-nomad) on each node during boot, setting the `--server` flag in both
   scripts.
1. Deploy as many client nodes as you need using the [nomad-cluster module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/nomad-cluster). Execute the
   [run-consul script](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul/tree/master/modules/run-consul) and the
   [run-nomad script](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/run-nomad) on each node during boot, setting the `--client` flag in both
   scripts.

Check out the [nomad-consul-colocated-cluster example](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/MAIN.md) for working
sample code.




## What's a Module?

A Module is a canonical, reusable, best-practices definition for how to run a single piece of infrastructure, such
as a database or server cluster. Each Module is created primarily using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/),
includes automated tests, examples, and documentation, and is maintained both by the open source community and
companies that provide commercial support.

Instead of having to figure out the details of how to run a piece of infrastructure from scratch, you can reuse
existing code that has been proven in production. And instead of maintaining all that infrastructure code yourself,
you can leverage the work of the Module community and maintainers, and pick up infrastructure improvements through
a version number bump.



## Who maintains this Module?

This Module is maintained by [Gruntwork](http://www.gruntwork.io/). If you're looking for help or commercial
support, send an email to [modules@gruntwork.io](mailto:modules@gruntwork.io?Subject=Nomad%20Module).
Gruntwork can help with:

* Setup, customization, and support for this Module.
* Modules for other types of infrastructure, such as VPCs, Docker clusters, databases, and continuous integration.
* Modules that meet compliance requirements, such as HIPAA.
* Consulting & Training on AWS, Terraform, and DevOps.



### Deploy Nomad and Consul in separate clusters

1. Deploy a standalone Consul cluster by following the instructions in the [Consul AWS
   Module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul).
1. Use the scripts from the [install-nomad module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/install-nomad) in a Packer template to create a Nomad AMI.
1. Deploy a small number of server nodes (typically, 3) using the [nomad-cluster module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/nomad). Execute the    
   [run-nomad script](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/run-nomad) on each node during boot, setting the `--server` flag. You will
   need to configure each node with the connection details for your standalone Consul cluster.   
1. Deploy as many client nodes as you need using the [nomad-cluster module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/nomad). Execute the
   [run-nomad script](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/run-nomad) on each node during boot, setting the `--client` flag.

Check out the [nomad-consul-separate-cluster example](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/examples/nomad-consul-separate-cluster) for working
sample code.





## How do I contribute to this Module?

Contributions are very welcome! Check out the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.



## How is this Module versioned?

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release,
along with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](../../releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
