# Nomad Install Script

This folder contains a script for installing Nomad and its dependencies. You can use this script, along with the
[run-nomad script](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/run-nomad) it installs to create a Nomad [Amazon Machine Image
(AMI)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) that can be deployed in
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) across an Auto Scaling Group using the [nomad-cluster module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/nomad-cluster).

This script has been tested on the following operating systems:

* Ubuntu 16.04
* Ubuntu 18.04
* Amazon Linux 2

There is a good chance it will work on other flavors of Debian, CentOS, and RHEL as well.



## Quick start

<!-- TODO: update the clone URL to the final URL when this Module is released -->

To install Nomad, use `git` to clone this repository at a specific tag (see the [releases page](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/releases)
for all available tags) and run the `install-nomad` script:

```
git clone --branch <VERSION> https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad.git
terraform-aws-nomad/modules/install-nomad/install-nomad --version 0.5.4
```

The `install-nomad` script will install Nomad, its dependencies, and the [run-nomad script](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/run-nomad).
You can then run the `run-nomad` script when the server is booting to start Nomad and configure it to automatically
join other nodes to form a cluster.

We recommend running the `install-nomad` script as part of a [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) template to create a
Nomad [Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) (see the
[nomad-consul-ami example](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/examples/nomad-consul-ami) for sample code). You can then deploy the AMI across an Auto
Scaling Group using the [nomad-cluster module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/nomad-cluster) (see the
[nomad-consul-colocated-cluster](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/MAIN.md) and
[nomad-consul-separate-cluster](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/examples/nomad-consul-separate-cluster) examples for fully-working sample code).




## Command line Arguments

The `install-nomad` script accepts the following arguments:

* `version VERSION`: Install Nomad version VERSION. Required.
* `path DIR`: Install Nomad into folder DIR. Optional.
* `user USER`: The install dirs will be owned by user USER. Optional.

Example:

```
install-nomad --version 0.5.4
```



## How it works

The `install-nomad` script does the following:

1. [Create a user and folders for Nomad](#create-a-user-and-folders-for-nomad)
1. [Install Nomad binaries and scripts](#install-nomad-binaries-and-scripts)
1. [Follow-up tasks](#follow-up-tasks)


### Create a user and folders for Nomad

Create an OS user named `nomad`. Create the following folders, all owned by user `nomad`:

* `/opt/nomad`: base directory for Nomad data (configurable via the `--path` argument).
* `/opt/nomad/bin`: directory for Nomad binaries.
* `/opt/nomad/data`: directory where the Nomad agent can store state.
* `/opt/nomad/config`: directory where the Nomad agent looks up configuration.
* `/opt/nomad/log`: directory where the Nomad agent will store log files.


### Install Nomad binaries and scripts

Install the following:

* `nomad`: Download the Nomad zip file from the [downloads page](https://www.nomadproject.io/downloads.html) (the
  version number is configurable via the `--version` argument), and extract the `nomad` binary into
  `/opt/nomad/bin`. Add a symlink to the `nomad` binary in `/usr/local/bin`.
* `run-nomad`: Copy the [run-nomad script](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-nomad/tree/master/modules/run-nomad) into `/opt/nomad/bin`.


### Follow-up tasks

After the `install-nomad` script finishes running, you may wish to do the following:

1. If you have custom Nomad config (`.hcl`) files, you may want to copy them into the config directory (default:
   `/opt/nomad/config`).
1. If `/usr/local/bin` isn't already part of `PATH`, you should add it so you can run the `nomad` command without
   specifying the full path.



## Dependencies

The install script assumes that `systemd` is already installed.  We use it as a cross-platform supervisor to ensure Nomad is started
whenever the system boots and restarted if the Nomad process crashes.  Additionally, it is used to store all logs which can be accessed
using `journalctl`.


## Why use Git to install this code?

<!-- TODO: update the package managers URL to the final URL when this Module is released -->

We needed an easy way to install these scripts that satisfied a number of requirements, including working on a variety
of operating systems and supported versioning. Our current solution is to use `git`, but this may change in the future.
See [Package Managers](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul/blob/master/_docs/package-managers.md) for
a full discussion of the requirements, trade-offs, and why we picked `git`.
